        Sans Soleil is a 1983 French found footage documentary
        <br>film directed by Chris Marker. It is a meditation on the
        <br>nature of human memory, showing the inability to recall
        <br>the context and nuances of memory, and how, as a result,
        <br>the perception of personal and global histories is affected.

        Expanding the documentary genre, this experimental essay-film is a composition of thoughts, images and scenes,
        mainly from Japan and Guinea-Bissau, "two extreme poles of survival".[1] Some other scenes were filmed in Cape
        Verde, Iceland, Paris, and San Francisco. A female narrator reads from letters supposedly sent to her by the
        (fictitious) cameraman Sandor Krasna.

        Sans Soleil is often labeled a documentary, travelogue, or essay-film. Despite the film's modest use of
        fictional content, it should not be confused with a mockumentary. The fictional content derived from the
        juxtaposition of narrative and image adds meaning to the film along with occasional nondescript movement between
        locations and lack of character-based narrative.

        Chris Marker has said: "On a more matter-of-fact level, I could tell you that the film intended to be, and is
        nothing more than, a home movie. I really think that my main talent has been to find people to pay for my home
        movies. Were I born rich, I guess I would have made more or less the same films, at least the traveling kind,
        but nobody would have heard of them except my friends and visitors."[2]
